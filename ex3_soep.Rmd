# Exercise 3 {.tabset}
## Questions

3.1 You should start with an income equation with hourly gross wages (do not use the log-transfromation for now). Predictor variables are years of education, labor force experience, sex and region.

3.2 Specify an interaction effect for sex and years of education. Interpret the results.

3.3 Present your results grafically using a marginal effects plot

3.4 Specify another interaction effect between years of education and labor force experience. Interpret the results. Use a marginal effects plot to do that.

3.5 Include a nominal (e. g. company size: pgallbet) variable with more than two categories as predictors using a dummy set.

3.6 Drop the interactions and the dummy set. Include duration of unemployment as additional predictor. What has the largest effect, years of education, labor force experience or duration of unemployment?

3.7 Specify a quadratic effect for labor force participation. Interpret the result using a marginal effects plot.

3.8 Now, use log-transformed income as dependent variable. Interpret the effect of years of education on income. Present your result in a table using estout or esttab.

## Answers {.active}
### 3.1 Basic Model {.tabset}
**You should start with an income equation with hourly gross wages `hwageb` (do not use the log-transfromation for now). Predictor variables are years of education `pgbilzeit`, labor force experience `erf`, sex `frau` and region `ost`.**


#### Stata
```{r stata 3.1, results = T, engine = "stata", engine.path= statapath, comment = ""}
use "_data/ex_mydf.dta", clear

reg hwageb pgbilzeit erf frau ost if asample==1 & syear==2015 [pw=phrf]
```

Overview of model with summary()
```{r model 3.1}
fit3.1  <- asample15 %>% 
            lm(hwageb~ pgbilzeit + erf + ost + frau, data=., weights=phrf)

summary(fit3.1)
```

##### version 2 {.active}
Overview of model with `tidy()` and `glance()` fro the `broom` package.
`glance()`gives an overview of the general model, while `tidy()` shows the results of the model and confidence intervals (those are optional).

# model coefficients

```

### 3.2 Interaction {.tabset}
**Specify an interaction effect for sex and years of education. Interpret the results.**

In the prior model, with only main effects, we could interpret the gender variable `frau` as the difference between females (1) and males (0). Now that we added the interaction term, we allow the slopes for years of education to differ between females and males. The presence of the interaction implies that the effect of education depends on the gender of a person. The term frau:pgbilzeit indicates the extend to which the difference between females and males changes for every year of education. The coefficient for years of education `pgbilzeit` indicates the effect of education on hourly wages for males (reference category: `frau == 0`). The model predicts, that for every increase of education by one unit (year), hourly wage increases by 1.84 € for males and by 1.84 € - 0.46 € = 1.38 € for females (all other factors held constant). 

This is visualized in the following plots of exercise 3.3.

#### R {.tabset .active}
##### Plots {.tabset}
###### Marginsplot
two versions, the first one more fancy code, the second a quick alternative.
An alternative way to model marginal effects is the [`margins`package](https://github.com/leeper/margins).
```{r model 3.3, out.width = "600px"}
# Marginsplot for Years of Education and Gender
 dat <- ggpredict(fit3.2, terms = c("pgbilzeit", "frau"))

# fancy plot
 ggplot(dat, aes(x, predicted, color = group, fill = group)) +
       geom_line()+
       geom_point()+
       geom_ribbon(ggplot2::aes_string(ymin = "conf.low", 
                ymax = "conf.high", color = NULL), alpha = 0.25) +
       labs(x = get_x_title(dat), y = get_y_title(dat))+
       ggtitle("Predicted Values for Hourly Wages in Prices of 2015")+
       guides(fill = guide_legend(title="Gender"),color = F)+
       theme(legend.position="bottom")
 
# quick alternative
 plot(dat)
 
```

###### Coeff-Plots
The following plots are created with `interplot()`. The plot showa the distribution of coefficients of `var1` conditional on values of `var2`. E.g. if we intend to know how the coefficients for years of education and gender are related, var1 could be years of education `pgbilzeit` while var2 is gender `frau`. One feature that I like about these plots is that yu can also specify a `hist`option in order to add the distribution of the variable who`s coefficients are being plottet.
The negative slope of the gender coefficient with increasing years of education, shows that with increasing years of education, the magnitude of the gender wage gap increases.
```{r coef plots}
# interplot notes: 
# m = the object of a regression result
# var1 = var whose coefficient is to be plotted 
# var2 = var on which the coefficient is conditional (var2)

# parameters:   point = wether a line or points are shown
#               hist = it can be helpful to the evaluation of the substantive significance of the conditional effect to know the distribution of the conditioning variable (years of education)

interplot(m = fit3.2 , var1 = "frau", var2= "pgbilzeit", point = F, hist = T) +
            theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(angle=45)) +
            xlab("Education (in years)") +
            ylab("Estimated Coefficient for\nGender") +
            ggtitle("Coefficients of Gender by Years of Education") +
            theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold")) +
            # Add a horizontal line at y = 0
            geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed")
      
interplot(m = fit3.2 ,var1 = "pgbilzeit" , var2="frau")+
            ggtitle("Coefficients of Education by Gender")

```

### 3.4 Interaction II {.tabset}
**Specify another interaction effect between years of education and labor force experience. Interpret the results. Use a marginal effects plot to do that.**

One can see in the marginsplot that the predicted hourly wage for the different values of years of work experience has different slopes depending on years of education. While there is almost no change in wage due to work experience for little education (e.g.7 yrs) the positive effect of work experience increases as years of education increase.

               data = ., weights = phrf)
      saveRDS(fit3.5, "out/fit3.5.rds")

      fit3.5 <- readRDS("out/fit3.5.rds")

```

### 3.6 Partial Effect Size {.tabset}
**Drop the interactions and the dummy set. Include duration of unemployment `pgexpue` as additional predictor. What has the largest effect, years of education `pgbilzeit`, labor force experience `erf` or duration of unemployment `pgexpue`.**

Years of education have the largest partial effect

standardization:

- if you wish to compare the partial effect sizes of the coefficients on your model, you need to standardize on both sides of the equations, the coefficients are then called beta- coefficients.

interpretation:

- beta- coefficients or standardized coefficients represent the change of y in terms of its standard deviation when x changes by 1 standard deviation. This way you can compare effect sizes of coefficients with different unit sizes.


#### Stata
```{r, results = T, engine = "stata", engine.path= statapath, comment = ""}
use "_data/ex_mydf.dta", clear

reg hwageb pgbilzeit erf pgexpue frau ost if asample==1 & syear==2015 [pw=phrf] , beta

### 3.7 Quadratic Effect {.tabset}
**Specify a quadratic effect for labor force participation. Interpret the result using a marginal effects plot.**

The marginsplot shows that the effect of work experience is quadratic, meaning that work experience has a stronger positive effect on hourly wage in the beginnign of a career, while the effect becomes smaller at the end of the career. It is also important to note that the confidence intervals are getting larger from 30 years of work experience onwards.
