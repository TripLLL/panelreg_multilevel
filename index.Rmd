# Multilevel Models in STATA and R

### Purpose of this site
This site contains .do files and .R scripts for multilevel modeling. It resulted from the exercises from a university course on that topic, where we discussed the basic statistical properties of the different models in a mostly non-technical way and used empirical data and Stata exercises to get familiar with their assumptions, features and interpretation. A couple of us then decided to "translate" the course excercises into R. We found that R has certain advantages, especially when it comes to visualizing the underlying data or models. 

#### Models
In this section you will find an overviw of the models and some comments, both for STATA and R.

1. [Random Intercept Model without IV](1_rimodel.html).
2. [Random Intercept Model with IV](2_rimodel.html).
3. [Random Coefficients Model](3_rcmodel.html).
4. [Cross-Level Interaction Model](4_crosslevelint.html).
5. [Cross-Classified Model](5_crossclass.html).
6. [3-Level Model](6_3level.html).
7. [Likelihood-Ratio Test](7_lrtest.html).

#### Data Preparation
[Here](0_create.html) you will find the data preparation that led to the underlying dataset of the models used on this website

#### Future
More stuff might follow.
