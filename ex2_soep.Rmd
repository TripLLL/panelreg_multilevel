# Exercise 2 {.tabset}

## Questions
- 2.1    Estimate a Linear Regression with SOEP Data using hourly wage `hwageb` as dependent variable for the year 2015. Include years of schooling `pgbilzeit` and work experience `erf` as predictor variables and gender `frau` and region `ost` as additional controls. 

- 2.2    Interpret the coefficients and the value of RÂ²

- 2.3    Is the relationship between work experience and wage linear?

- 2.4    Specifiy the same regression model but use the natural logarithm `lnwage` as dependent variable instead. 

- 2.5    How large is the gender pay gap?

## Data Prep {.tabset}
### Stata
```{r stata data prep, results = T, engine = "stata", engine.path= statapath, comment = ""}
use "_data/ex_mydf.dta", clear

* Unplausible Beobachtungen identifizieren
********************************************************************************
      twoway (scatter hwageb pgtatzeit, msymbol(point) jitter(2))

* Visualize Income
********************************************************************************
      histogram hwageb if asample==1, bin(25)
	sum hwageb if asample==1, d
	twoway (scatter hwageb pgtatzeit, msymbol(point) jitter(2)) if asample==1
      
```

### R {.tabset}
#### Load Data
```{r load data}
ex_mydf <- readRDS(file = "_data/ex_mydf.rds")

asample <- ex_mydf %>% 
        filter(pgtatzeit >= 6,
               !is.na(pgtatzeit),
               alter %>% dplyr::between(18, 65),
               !is.na(alter),
               pgemplst %in% c(1,2,4),
               pop < 3
               )  %>%
      # filter unplausible cases
      mutate(na = case_when(
              pid %in% c(1380202, 1380202, 607602, 2555301) ~ 1,
              pid == 8267202 & syear == 2007 ~ 1,
              pid == 2633801 & syear == 2006 ~ 1,
              pid == 2582901 & syear > 2006 ~ 1 )
             ) %>% 
      filter(is.na(na)) %>% 
      select(hwageb, lnwage, pgbilzeit, cpgbilzeit, erf, cerf, frau, ost, phrf, syear )

asample15 <- asample %>% filter(syear == 2015)
```

#### Descriptive Pre - Analysis
##### unplausible Cases
```{r unplausible cases ex2, out.width= "300 px"}
# to do: show id if wage above 600
ex_mydf %>% 
      select(pgtatzeit, hwageb) %>% 
      drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=pgtatzeit, y=hwageb)) + 
        geom_point(position = "jitter", size = 0.21, alpha = 0.1)

  # nochmal scatter
  ggplot(asample, aes(x=pgbilzeit, y=hwageb)) + 
        geom_point(position = "jitter", size = 0.21, alpha = 0.1,
                   na.rm = T)
```

##### visualize Income {.tabset}
Here you can see three different ways to plot histograms in R:
###### Histogram
```{r viz income ex2,  out.width= "200 px"}
  summary(asample$hwageb)
  
# qplot
  qplot(hwageb, geom="histogram",
        binwidth = 25,  
        main = "Histogram for Hourly Wage", 
        xlab = "Hourly Wage in Prices from 2015",  
        fill=I("grey"), 
        col=I("black"), 
        alpha= I(.2),
        xlim=c(0,500),
        ylim= c(0,125000),
        data = asample)
  
 # ggplot alternative
 # without ..density it would be counts
  g_hist_wage <- asample %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = hwageb, y = ..density..)) +
        geom_histogram(breaks = seq(0,767.4, by = 25)) + 
        labs(title="Histogram for Hourly Wage in 2015 Prices",
             x="Hourly Wage")
  
  g_hist_wage
  
  # hist command
  hist(asample$hwageb, probability = T)
```

##### for 2015
summary of hourly wage and yrs of schooling, work exp, etc.
```{r analysis for 2015}
  asample %>%
      filter(syear == 2015) %>% 
      select(hwageb, pgbilzeit, erf, frau, ost) %>%
      drop_na() %>%  # optional if complete.obs is specified
      cor(use = "complete.obs")
  
  asample %>%
        filter(syear == 2015) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(pgbilzeit, hwageb)) +
            geom_point(na.rm=T, position = "jitter")
```

### 2.1 Basic Model{.tabset}
**Estimate a Linear Regression with SOEP Data using hourly wage `hwageb` as dependent variable for the year 2015. Include years of schooling `pgbilzeit` and work experience `erf` as predictor variables and gender `frau` and region `ost` as additional controls**. 

***

Note: **STATA command if e(sample):** *In STATA, there is a practical command if e(sample) that lets you restrict new calculations to the observations that were used in a model calculated before. In this exercise this can be used to calculate centralized coefficients for education and compare two models with each other, making sure that they are based on the same observations. In this exercise, the basic model is calculated first (2.1) and then another model is run with the same sample, but with centralized years of education and work experience (2.1c) in order to be able to interpret the intercept in a theoretically coherent way.*

Note2: **STATA - R Difference concerning weights in regression models.** *STATA and R handle weights with the value of 0 differently. While STATA drops these observations by default, R does not. In theory, weights of 0 should not exist, because sampling weights are supposed to be the inverse of the probability of being sampled. In survey data, sampling weights of 0 can be included because the weights are adjusted in various ways. If you want to include cases with 0 weights in STATA regressions you need to use the svy option as described [here](https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/statistics/svy-and-zero-weights/). If, on the other hand you want to exclude them from the R model, you can use a filter before modeling (e.g. `filter(phrf > 0)`). For the basic model in this exercise both ways are shown here (First without 0-weight observations, then with).*

This code produces a set of four plots: residuals versus fitted values, a Q-Q plot of standardized residuals, a scale-location plot (square roots of standardized residuals versus fitted values) and a plot of residuals versus leverage that adds bands corresponding to Cook's distances of 0.5 and 1.
The par option is specified, in order to display all four of them at once and not in separate steps. This option is revoked afterwards. You can type ?par into R to learn more.
```{r plot2 fit2.1}

### 2.2 coefficients and RÂ² {.tabset}
**Interpret the coefficients and the value of RÂ² **

***

**Model 2.1 Coefficients**

- Intercept
- The intercept is negative, which does not make theoretical sense because wages cannot be negative. Mathematically it reflects the predicted value if all explanatory variables are equal to 0. Since there is "Schulpflicht" in Germany, it is not the case that there are people with no education at all in the dataset. Since there are no observations with education < 7, the model cannot predict those cases successfully. In order to be able to interpret the intercept after all, one can center the variables.
      
- Years of Education (`pgbilzeit`)
      - For each unit (year) increase of education, hourly wage is expected to increase by 1.64 units (Euro).

- Work Experience (`erf`)
      - For each increase of working experience by one year, the expects income increases by 0,24 Euro/hour. 
      
- Gender (`frau`)
      - Women are expected to earn 2.75 Euro less per hour compared to men.
      
- Region (`ost`)
      - People who grew up in former eastern germany are estimated to earn 4.26 Euro less, compared to people who grew up in former western Germany.
      
- R-squared
      - The model can explain 22.59% of the overall variance of hourly wages in Germany.

**Model 2.1c Coefficients**

- Intercept
- With the variables education and work experience centered, one can interpret the intercept as: For male Germans (`frau` == 0) who were born in former West Germany (`ost` == 0) and with average years of education (`cpgbilzeit`) and average years of work experience (`cerf`), the expected hourly wage is 18,51 Euro/h. 

- One can now also predict the wages for other groups by adding the values of the coefficients and the intercept. E.g. The model predicts hourly wages of `18.51 - 2.75 = 15.76` Euro/h for females compared to 18.51 Euro/h for males, holding education and work experience equal.
      

### 2.3 work experience and wage {.tabset}
**Is the relationship between work experience and wage linear?**

***

Labor market research found that the relationship of work and wage is not linear. In the cprplots one can see the that model that assumes linearity systematically overestimates people with long work experience. The solution to this would be to use the squared term of work experience in the model.

### 2.4 Log Model {.tabset}
**Specifiy the same regression model but use the natural logarithm as dependent variable instead. \n How does the the interpretation of coefficients change?**

***

**Why use log of wage?** The distribution of hourly wage is very right skewed while the log(wage) is closer to a normal distribution. Since the dependent variable is now the natural logarithm, it is not very intuitive to interpret.

How does the the interpretation of coefficients change?

- Now that we calculate a Log-Level-Effect the coefficient of x would stand for the change in ln(y), if x changes by one unit. In order to be better able to interpret the coefficients, we can interpret the exponential form of the model. Then the coefficient of x by one unit stands for $e^b$. The coefficients can now be interpreted as percentage change. 

#### Stata
```{r stata 2.4, results = T, engine = "stata", engine.path= statapath, comment = ""}

use "_data/ex_mydf.dta", clear
	
* Mincer-Equation
	reg lnwage pgbilzeit erf frau ost if asample==1 & syear==2015 [pw=phrf]
	
      dis exp(.0868897)	
      dis  .3956569^2
```
#### R {.tabset .active}
Model
```{r}
 fit2.4 <- asample15 %>% 
        lm(lnwage ~ pgbilzeit + erf + frau + ost,
           data = ., weights = phrf)

 tidy(fit2.4, conf.int = T)
 glance(fit2.4)
```

Interpretation of coefficients 
Example coefficient for education:
`exp(.0871554) = 1.09` -> for every increase of education by one unit (year), wage grows by 9%

```{r}
  exp(.0871554)	
```
  
If you want to know the change of 8 years more education:
`exp(.0871554)^8 = 2,01` -> 101% increase
```{r}
   exp(.0871554)^8   
```
